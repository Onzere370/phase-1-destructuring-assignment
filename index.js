// Strings

// 1. Use destructuring to assign appropriate variables based on the sounds animals make.

// 2. Bolt the horse wandered off, so just give us four animals, and let's name them bessie, dolly, babe, and little.

// 3. Little the chicken had to go back to the coop, so now we're left with three. Let's use color variables of blackAndWhite, black, and pink.

// Arrays

// 4. Use destructuring to assign appropriate variables using the color names.

// 5. Some people have a really hard time picking out indigo, so let's leave that one out, using the first letter of each color as the variable names.

// 6. But wait! Indigo is now feeling *super* left out. Let's only assign indigo using indg. 

// Objects

// 7. Use destructuring to assign all variables using the keys as the variable names

// 8. Use destructuring to assign songs 2 and 4, and Kermit's job and partner
